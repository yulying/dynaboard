# Dynamic Dashboard
A dashboard web application that can be customized with different widgets to cater to personalized needs.
<br />
<br />

## About The Project
Organizing thoughts and information is extremely important but also very accessible, whether it's to jot down notes, keep personal reminders, or plan out their day. However, even though there are many options to choose from, rarely does one software offer truely versatile methods of customizing dashboards for everyone.

Although the task requires substantial amount of development, Dynamic Dashboard aims to start with the basics and build up with increasing functionality while keeping up with aesthetics with the goal of allowing anyone to arrange and organize however they want in their day to day lives.

Create a new account or login if an account is already made. Users who have already logged in with their browser can navigate to [https://www.dynaboard.net](https://www.dynaboard.net) which will automatically log them in using JSON Web Tokens to securely streamline the login process. This also prevents unauthorized users from accessing other users' dashboards. <br />

An empty dashboard should be created with your unique user id or populated with saved data if data is already created under the user id. <br />
